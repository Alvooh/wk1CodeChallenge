WeeK1: Code Challenge

2024/03/22

By Alvin Obala 

## Description
Three javascript scripts that do the following 
1.grades.js - prompts the user to enter student marks and then outputs the correct grade:

2.netSalary.js - calculates an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits

3.speed.js - takes as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it gives the driver one demerit point and prints the total number of demerit points.
